      function definition (give them in natural language). These test cases should
      give us 100% coverage of the code.\nAfter that derive a complete list of requirements
      for the given function definition. Use completely implementation-independent
      vocabulary. A requirement is a single, complete, and testable statement of the
      expected behaviour of a single semantic part of the code.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample
      1:\n```c\nfloat calculate_discount(float total_amount, bool is_member) {\n    if
      (total_amount < 0) {\n        return -1.0;  // Error case\n    }\n    if (is_member)
      {\n        return total_amount * 0.9;\n    }\n    return total_amount;\n}\n```\nTest
      cases:\n1. Test with negative total amount\n2. Test with member status and positive
      amount\n3. Test with non-member status and positive amount\n\nRequirements:\n1.
      The system shall return an error indicator when the total amount is negative\n2.
      The system shall apply a 10% discount when calculating the final amount for
      members\n3. The system shall return the original amount without modification
      for non-members\n\nExample 2:\n```c\nbool validate_password(const char* password)
      {\n    if (password == NULL) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    if (strlen(password)
      < 8) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    bool has_uppercase = false;\n    for
      (int i = 0; password[i] != ''\\0''; i++) {\n        if (isupper(password[i]))
      {\n            has_uppercase = true;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return
      has_uppercase;\n}\n```\nTest cases:\n1. Test with NULL password pointer\n2.
      Test with password shorter than 8 characters\n3. Test with password of 8+ characters
      but no uppercase letter\n4. Test with password of 8+ characters including uppercase
      letter\n\nRequirements:\n1. The system shall reject invalid password pointers\n2.
      The system shall reject passwords that are less than 8 characters in length\n3.
      The system shall reject passwords that do not contain at least one uppercase
      letter\n4. The system shall accept passwords that are at least 8 characters
      long and contain at least one uppercase letter\n\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence
      between requirements and test cases. Make sure each semantic part of the code
      is covered by exactly one test case and one requirement.\n\nRequirements should
      fulfill the following criteria:\n\u2014 Necessary. The requirement defines an
      essential capability, characteristic, constraint and/or quality factor. If it
      is not included in the set of requirements, a deficiency in capability or characteristic
      will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by implementing other requirements. The
      requirement is currently applicable and has not been made obsolete by the passage
      of time. Requirements with planned expiration dates or applicability dates are
      clearly identified.\n\u2014 Appropriate. The specific intent and amount of detail
      of the requirement is appropriate to the level of the entity to which it refers
      (level of abstraction appropriate to the level of entity). This includes avoiding
      unnecessary constraints on the architecture or design while allowing implementation
      independence to the extent possible.\n\u2014 Unambiguous. The requirement is
      stated in such a way so that it can be interpreted in only one way.  The requirement
      is stated simply and is easy to understand.\n\u2014 Complete. The requirement
      sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor to meet the entity need without needing other information
      to understand the requirement. This means it should be possible to implement
      the function based on the set of requirements without needing additional information.\n\u2014
      Singular. The requirement states a single capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor.\n\u2014 Feasible. The requirement can be realized within
      system constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical) with acceptable risk.\n\u2014
      Verifiable. The requirement is structured and worded such that its realization
      can be proven (verified) to the customer''s satisfaction at the level the requirements
      exists. Verifiability is enhanced when the requirement is measurable.\n\u2014
      Correct. The requirement is an accurate representation of the entity need from
      which it was transformed.\n\u2014 Conforming. The individual items conform to
      an approved standard template and style for writing requirements, when applicable.\n\n\nReturn

      for the given function definition. Use completely implementation-independent
      vocabulary. A requirement is a single, complete, and testable statement of the
      expected behaviour of a single semantic part of the code.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nExample
      1:\n```c\nfloat calculate_discount(float total_amount, bool is_member) {\n    if
      (total_amount < 0) {\n        return -1.0;  // Error case\n    }\n    if (is_member)

      cases:\n1. Test with negative total amount\n2. Test with member status and positive
      amount\n3. Test with non-member status and positive amount\n\nRequirements:\n1.
      The system shall return an error indicator when the total amount is negative\n2.
      The system shall apply a 10% discount when calculating the final amount for
      members\n3. The system shall return the original amount without modification
      for non-members\n\nExample 2:\n```c\nbool validate_password(const char* password)
      {\n    if (password == NULL) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    if (strlen(password)

      has_uppercase;\n}\n```\nTest cases:\n1. Test with NULL password pointer\n2.
      Test with password shorter than 8 characters\n3. Test with password of 8+ characters
      but no uppercase letter\n4. Test with password of 8+ characters including uppercase
      letter\n\nRequirements:\n1. The system shall reject invalid password pointers\n2.
      The system shall reject passwords that are less than 8 characters in length\n3.
      The system shall reject passwords that do not contain at least one uppercase
      letter\n4. The system shall accept passwords that are at least 8 characters
      long and contain at least one uppercase letter\n\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence
      between requirements and test cases. Make sure each semantic part of the code
      is covered by exactly one test case and one requirement.\n\nRequirements should
      fulfill the following criteria:\n\u2014 Necessary. The requirement defines an
      essential capability, characteristic, constraint and/or quality factor. If it
      is not included in the set of requirements, a deficiency in capability or characteristic
      will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by implementing other requirements. The
      requirement is currently applicable and has not been made obsolete by the passage
      of time. Requirements with planned expiration dates or applicability dates are
      clearly identified.\n\u2014 Appropriate. The specific intent and amount of detail
      of the requirement is appropriate to the level of the entity to which it refers
      (level of abstraction appropriate to the level of entity). This includes avoiding
      unnecessary constraints on the architecture or design while allowing implementation
      independence to the extent possible.\n\u2014 Unambiguous. The requirement is
      stated in such a way so that it can be interpreted in only one way.  The requirement
      is stated simply and is easy to understand.\n\u2014 Complete. The requirement
      sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor to meet the entity need without needing other information
      to understand the requirement. This means it should be possible to implement
      the function based on the set of requirements without needing additional information.\n\u2014
      Singular. The requirement states a single capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor.\n\u2014 Feasible. The requirement can be realized within
      system constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical) with acceptable risk.\n\u2014
      Verifiable. The requirement is structured and worded such that its realization
      can be proven (verified) to the customer''s satisfaction at the level the requirements

      Test with password shorter than 8 characters\n3. Test with password of 8+ characters

      letter\n\nRequirements:\n1. The system shall reject invalid password pointers\n2.
      The system shall reject passwords that are less than 8 characters in length\n3.
      The system shall reject passwords that do not contain at least one uppercase
      letter\n4. The system shall accept passwords that are at least 8 characters

      between requirements and test cases. Make sure each semantic part of the code
      is covered by exactly one test case and one requirement.\n\nRequirements should
      fulfill the following criteria:\n\u2014 Necessary. The requirement defines an
      essential capability, characteristic, constraint and/or quality factor. If it
      is not included in the set of requirements, a deficiency in capability or characteristic
      will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by implementing other requirements. The
      requirement is currently applicable and has not been made obsolete by the passage
      of time. Requirements with planned expiration dates or applicability dates are
      clearly identified.\n\u2014 Appropriate. The specific intent and amount of detail
      of the requirement is appropriate to the level of the entity to which it refers
      (level of abstraction appropriate to the level of entity). This includes avoiding
      unnecessary constraints on the architecture or design while allowing implementation
      independence to the extent possible.\n\u2014 Unambiguous. The requirement is
      stated in such a way so that it can be interpreted in only one way.  The requirement
      is stated simply and is easy to understand.\n\u2014 Complete. The requirement
      sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor to meet the entity need without needing other information
      to understand the requirement. This means it should be possible to implement
      the function based on the set of requirements without needing additional information.\n\u2014
      Singular. The requirement states a single capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor.\n\u2014 Feasible. The requirement can be realized within
      system constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical) with acceptable risk.\n\u2014
      Verifiable. The requirement is structured and worded such that its realization
      can be proven (verified) to the customer''s satisfaction at the level the requirements
      exists. Verifiability is enhanced when the requirement is measurable.\n\u2014
      Correct. The requirement is an accurate representation of the entity need from
      which it was transformed.\n\u2014 Conforming. The individual items conform to
      an approved standard template and style for writing requirements, when applicable.\n\n\nReturn

      of the requirement is appropriate to the level of the entity to which it refers
      (level of abstraction appropriate to the level of entity). This includes avoiding
      unnecessary constraints on the architecture or design while allowing implementation
      independence to the extent possible.\n\u2014 Unambiguous. The requirement is
      stated in such a way so that it can be interpreted in only one way.  The requirement
      is stated simply and is easy to understand.\n\u2014 Complete. The requirement
      sufficiently describes the necessary capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor to meet the entity need without needing other information
      to understand the requirement. This means it should be possible to implement
      the function based on the set of requirements without needing additional information.\n\u2014
      Singular. The requirement states a single capability, characteristic, constraint
      or quality factor.\n\u2014 Feasible. The requirement can be realized within
      system constraints (e.g., cost, schedule, technical) with acceptable risk.\n\u2014
      Verifiable. The requirement is structured and worded such that its realization
      can be proven (verified) to the customer''s satisfaction at the level the requirements
      exists. Verifiability is enhanced when the requirement is measurable.\n\u2014
      Correct. The requirement is an accurate representation of the entity need from
      which it was transformed.\n\u2014 Conforming. The individual items conform to
      an approved standard template and style for writing requirements, when applicable.\n\n\nReturn
